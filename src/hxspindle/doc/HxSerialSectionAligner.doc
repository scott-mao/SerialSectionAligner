\begin{hxdescription}
  The Serial Section Aligner allows users to stitch multiple serial sections
  with filament data. The sections are aligned to remove distortions and the
  filaments are matched over section boundaries.

  The tool has a separate rendering and interaction pipeline. Thus, all other
  viewer modules should by hidden when using the tool.

  The full navigation and interaction within the different views is done by
  interaction tool (the arrow icon). With the left mouse button pressed you can
  move the data. To zoom, press the left mouse button together with the mouse
  wheel button while moving the mouse up and down.

  One can switch between different pairs of neighboring sections either by using
  the slider Section Interface or when in alignment mode by a click into a section
  of the stack in the bottom right viewer. In several views a slice of the two
  sections is shown. There are two sliders to change the currently visualized
  slices in the upper and in the lower section Slice Position Top and Slice Position
  Bottom. By default the sliders are synchronized, which means by increasing the
  upper slider, the lower is decreased. One can deactivate the synchronization in
  the advanced settings.

  The tool consists of two modes, the alignment mode and the matching mode.

  \textbf{Alignment Mode}

  This mode serves the primary purpose to set manual landmarks for a rough alignment
  based on macroscopic features (e.g. vesicles). Here the viewer contains the
  following information. In the top left one can see a slice of the upper section
  and in the bottom left a slice of the lower section. The top right view shows a
  blending of the two selected slices to support the alignment process. In the bottom
  right one can find an illustration of the stack. The two neighboring sections
  highlighted in yellow and blue are currently selected.

  One can add manual landmarks (red) with a left click into one of the left views
  while holding ctrl on the keyboard. One can move landmarks by selecting them with
  the left mouse button and holding the button during moving. Furthermore, a landmark
  can be removed with a click on it while holding again ctrl. During the creation and
  movement of landmarks, the overlay view is immediately updated and shows the current
  state of the alignment.

  \textbf{Matching Mode}

  This mode allows you to set matchings between filaments of neighboring sections.
  The viewer now contains the following information. The top right viewer is similar
  to its representation in Alignment Mode and again shows a blending of the two
  selected slices. Matched filaments can be identified by their color, while unmatched
  filaments appear in black. The viewer also contains a crosshair. The crosshair
  corresponds to the two viewers on the left. The upper view shows a local part of
  the filament data set in 3D and the lower shows a side view of the two sections.
  The range of the 3D view can be modified in the advanced settings. The lower right
  viewer contains a graphical representation of the matching states based on the lower
  slice. Dark regions contain no matched filaments, slightly brighter regions contain
  automatically matched but unconfirmed filaments and bright regions contain confirmed
  matches of filaments.

  One can edit matching manually in the top right view. Two left mouse clicks with
  pressed ctrl on two filament ends of both sections will either add or remove the
  corresponding matching. Note that some filaments can be matched multiple times because
  their start and end is connected to the other section.

  The automatic matching algorithm is executed with the compute button based on the
  current alignment state. The automatic landmarks checkbox controls whether prior to
  the automatic matching additional landmarks are placed at the filament endpoints and
  are aligned automatically. Automatic landmarks will afterwards also become visible
  and controllable in alignment mode. The clear button clears matches and optionally
  also automatic landmarks if the checkbox is selected.

  The controls after Matching Check allow to randomly step through the array of the
  filament endpoints in the lower slice (use shortcut n for >). Note that the
  crosshair adjusts by aligning one axis along the direction of the filament in the
  lower slice. Filament ends can also be selected from the viewer by left clicking
  on them. The Confirm button (or shortcut c) will confirm the filement end state.
  Thus, the match and the corresponding landmarks are even kept when the automatic
  matches are cleared. After confirming a match while stepping using the < and > buttons,
  the viewer will randomly jump to a new position in the array and stepping back is not
  possible anymore. Note that all manual matched end points are automatically confirmed.
  To reset all status information type SerialSectionAligner clearCheck into the console.
  However, this should be only used in extreme cases.

  As mentioned above manually placed matching will also create landmarks of the type
  "manual matches" and are used for alignment. In some data sets this has shown to
  create strong local distortions especially in case of filament crossing the boundary
  at a flat angle. The creation of these landmarks can be inhibited by selecting the
  matched endpoint of the bottom section and using the shortcut f.

  Note that shortcuts are only available when the viewer is active, i.e. after the
  viewer was selected by interaction.

  To clear all alignment and matching information of the current selected interface,
  type SerialSectionAligner clear into the console. However, this should be only used
  in extreme cases.

  In the lower right view, one can see small histograms over time that show the density
  of microtubule end points in z-direcion. The first two bars correspond to the second
  half of the lower section and the other two bars correspond to the first half of the
  upper section. The histogram is computed only for the overlapping parts, thus it can
  help to analyze the quality of the current matching. The same histogram for the full
  stack is shown in the alignment view.
